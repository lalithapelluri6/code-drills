For this exercise you will not create a function. Your job instead is to get a poor farmer and his livestock across a grueling river.

The farmer needs to get a chicken, a fox and a bag of grain across a river. He's in quite the pickle though. The only boat around is a small, rickety thing that can only carry him (the farmer) and one of his cargo at a time. That means whenever the farmer crosses the river, he'll have to leave at least two of his animals/possesions behind.

What's worse, if he leaves the chicken and fox alone together, the fox will eat the chicken. If he leaves the chicken and grain alone, the chicken will eat the grain.

Using only the farmer's rickety boat and its rules, help him get across the river with all of his companions.



ANSWER:  The man and the chicken goes first since the grain is safe with the Fox. he leaves the chicken on the other side
and goes back to get the fox to the other side. since the chicken is not safe with fox he takes chicken with him and
goes back to get the grain bag. since the chicken and the grain cannot left together he left the chicken there and get
the grain to the other side and leave it with fox. He then turn to get the chicken and heads accross the river one last time.
